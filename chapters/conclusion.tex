\chapter{Conclusion}

To measure the effectiveness of several alias analysis techniques, we instrument several benchmarks from the SPEC2000 benchmark suite, the PLB benchmark suite, the malloc benchmark suite, and some self-implemented benchmarks, to print information about which memory addresses are accessed. We used this information to measure the accuracy of different alias analyses by mapping the memory addresses to the original operands, and comparing this to the alias sets generated by the analyses. We found that the alias analyses were equally effective for most of the benchmarks used. Of the benchmarks we used, we found the bzip2, crafty, and vpr benchmarks from the SPEC2000 suite, the sudoku and matmul benchmarks from the PLB suite, and the tree benchmark, to be the most effective at testing alias analysis techniques while being representative of real-world memory access patterns. We also explored other program statistics that could provide insights into memory access patterns, namely alias lifetimes, allocation sizes, and allocation lifetimes.
