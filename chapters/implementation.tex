\section{LLVM Instrumentation}
To measure the effectiveness of various alias analyses, we instrument a series of C programs to obtain data about which memory addresses are accessed. We perform this instrumentation on LLVM source files translated from the original C source code to have finer granularity of instrumentation; even without explicit pointer operations or variable assignment, individual expressions or statements may contain multiple memory accesses that are not easily captured at the level of the target language. At the LLVM level, pointer values are also stored within virtual registers alongside variables, providing additional aliases to quantify. For program instrumentation, we are primarily concerned with three types of instructions: load, store, and getelementptr. For these instructions, we output the referenced memory address, along with additional information that we use to find the original virtual registers within the corresponding LLVM file.
