Programming has come a very long way from writing basic binary instructions. Over time, the emergence of different programming languages has widened the availability and range of applications of possible software projects. One of the most critical advances provided by newer programming languages is the level of abstraction they offer. Different features of programming languages, such as data types or garbage collection, have helped programmers move past machine-specific details to focus on more complex problems. Although software development has made significant advances over the past several decades, improved performance continues to be one of the chief concerns of both software producers and consumers. Principal concerns regarding performance include program speed, and efficient resource usage, such as memory and I/O devices, and are inherent to all programming languages regardless of abstraction level.
